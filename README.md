## Source Styling Conventions

Every sentence in the HIG should be on exactly one line.
This allows the git software that we use to track changes on the HIG to present more coherent diffs, allowing us to better track changes to a file.
In general, that means that every header is a single line, every sentence (measured by the final period) is a single line, and every list item is a single line, or multiple lines if it has multiple sentences.
